## sort explanation

Here's a breakdown of the full app functionality in a few key terms:

**Data Fetching:**

- Fetches user data from an API on component mount.
- Stores the data in the `userData` state variable.

**Sorting:**

- Allows sorting users based on various criteria (total score, friends, influence, chirpiness).
- Uses a separate state variable (`sortOrder`) to track ascending or descending order.
- Updates the displayed data (`displayedData`) with the sorted results.

**Filtering:**

- Enables filtering users by joined date between a selected start and end date.
- Uses state variables (`startDate` and `endDate`) to store selected dates.
- Filters the displayed data based on the join date.

**Deletion:**

- Allows deleting individual users (likely with further confirmation steps).
- Uses a state variable (`DeleteID`) to store the ID of the user to be deleted.
- Filters the displayed data to exclude the user with the matching ID.

**User Display:**

- Renders each user using a separate `UserData` component.
- The `UserData` component displays the user's fullname, Twubric scores (total, friends, influence, chirpiness), and joined date.
- Provides a button to remove the user (presumably with confirmation).

**Combined State (`displayedData`):**

- This app uses a combined state variable (`displayedData`) to manage the data displayed on the screen.
- It reflects the results after sorting, filtering, and deletion are applied.
- This simplifies state management and avoids the need for separate state variables for each step.

## Full Explanation of `App.js` and `UserData.js`

**App.js:**

This file defines the main React component named `App`. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

**1. Imports:**

- `React`: The core library for building user interfaces.
- `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing component state and side effects.
- `UserData` component (likely imported from a separate file `./components/UserData`).

**2. State Variables:**

- `userData`: An array state variable to store the original user data fetched from an API (assumed).
- `displayedData`: A combined state variable to store the data that will be displayed after sorting, filtering, and deletion (replacing separate variables used earlier).
- `sortOrder`: A state variable to keep track of the current sorting order (ascending or descending).
- `sortInfo`: An object state variable to store information about the current sorting (type and order).
- `DeleteID`: A state variable to store the ID of a user to be deleted (if applicable).
- `startDate` and `endDate`: State variables to store selected dates for date filtering.

**3. Functions:**

- `handleStartDateChange` and `handleEndDateChange`: These functions handle changes in the date picker inputs. They convert the selected date string to seconds since epoch and update the corresponding state variables.
- `handelSort`: This function handles sorting the user data based on the selected criteria (total score, friends, influence, chirpiness). It sorts the `userData` array (or `displayedData` if already sorted) based on the chosen property and updates the `displayedData`, `sortInfo`, and `sortOrder` state variables.
- `useEffect` hooks: There are three `useEffect` hooks used for data fetching, filtering, and handling deletions:
  - The first `useEffect` fetches user data from an API using `async/await` and stores it in the `userData` state variable. It also includes error handling with a `try...catch` block (although displaying the error to the user needs to be implemented).
  - The second `useEffect` handles filtering and sorting. It creates a copy of the `userData` or `displayedData` (depending on sorting state), applies sorting if necessary, applies date filtering if both dates are selected, and updates the `displayedData` state with the filtered and potentially sorted data. This hook runs whenever `userData`, `sortOrder`, `startDate`, or `endDate` changes.
  - The third `useEffect` handles deleting a user. It filters the `userData` to exclude the user with the matching `DeleteID` and updates the `displayedData` state. This hook runs whenever `DeleteID` or `userData` changes.

**4. Return Statement:**

- The `return` statement defines the JSX structure of the component, which will be rendered on the screen. The JSX includes:
  - A section for sorting options with buttons that trigger the `handelSort` function on click.
  - A section for date filtering with date pickers that trigger the respective date change functions.
  - A third section that displays information about the current sorting and renders each user using the `UserData` component. It conditionally displays a message if there's no data to display or maps through the `displayedData` to render each user.

**UserData.js:**

This file defines the `UserData` component, which is responsible for rendering information about a single user.

**1. Imports:**

- `React`: The core library for building user interfaces.

**2. Destructuring Props:**

- The component receives a single prop named `data` which is an object containing user information. It destructures the object to access properties like `uid`, `fullname`, individual Twubric scores (total, friends, influence, chirpiness), and `join_date`.

**3. Data Formatting:**

- The `join_date` is converted into a JavaScript Date object.
- The date is formatted into a user-friendly string format using `toLocaleString()`.

**4. Return Statement:**

- The `return` statement defines the JSX structure for rendering a user's information. It includes:
  - A grid layout with rows and columns for different user details.
  - The user's fullname with bold styling.
  - The user's Twubric score displayed in the first column.
  - Each Twubric category (friends, influence, chirpiness) displayed with respective values.
  - The formatted join date displayed in the first column of the last row.
  - A "Remove" button that triggers the deletion functionality (presumably passed as a prop `setDeleteID`) when clicked.

**Overall:**

These two files work together to create a user management application. `App.js` handles fetching user
